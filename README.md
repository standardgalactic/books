# Umbilicus

Various programming and math books


This is a proof of concept for Scholar's Bay. Unfortunately the mp3 and umbilicus files are dead links. I am hosting a local server with access to all files, but it will be unreliable as I occasionally have to restart my computer.

- This might be completely useless to anyone but me but I started a little *[Scholar's Bay](https://acbb-159-2-201-107.ngrok-free.app/)* server running on my computer with some old audiobooks and pdfs. It's running on a server on my computer so *please don't hack me.*
